A simple chess game built to show off design patterns for 2511!

## How to run?

Firstly you'll need gradle!

You can find it [here](https://gradle.org/install/).

Then all you need to run is;

```bash
gradle eclipse
gradle run
```

> NOTE: You may also have to clean the java (`> java: clean the workspace` command) after runnign the eclipse to get it to recognise javafx.

> Hopefully!
